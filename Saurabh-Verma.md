# Saurabh Jagdish Prasad Verma

I’m Saurabh Verma, currently pursuing a Master’s in Business Analytics & Information Systems at the University of South Florida and I have completed my Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science.

Before starting my master’s, I gained over three years of experience as a Business Intelligence Engineer at Accenture, where I specialized in designing scalable data models, developing ETL pipelines, and creating impactful BI dashboards. 

With a passion for data and analytics, I am eager to leverage my experience and knowledge in a dynamic and collaborative environment. 

Interesting fact about me is, I played national level football (soccer) representing my under grad University.
